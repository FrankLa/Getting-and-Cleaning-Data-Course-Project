***************************  
This repository contains my work for the course project in Coursera: "Getting and Cleaning Data".



## Introduction
***************************
In this project, a raw data set is available from  
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

I will then retrieve and clean it in order to create a new, tidy data set.



## List of files in the project
***************************
The project includes the following files:

#### `ReadMe.md`

This file provides a general description of the project as well as how all the present scripts are linked.

#### `CodeBook.md`

This file explains the procedures to process the raw data set in order to obtain the tidy data set `tidyDataAvg.txt`. In addition, it describes the data and variables in `tidyDataAvg.txt`.

#### `tidyDataAvg.txt`

This is the output of the project, containing the desired data set. It is obtained by running `run_analysis.R`.

#### `run_analysis.R`

This is the `R` script used for cleaning the original data set. 


#### [*Appendix*] `ListofFeatures.md`

This file is an Appendix which lists of the features present in the tidy data set.
